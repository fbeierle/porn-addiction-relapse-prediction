This repository contains the data processing, machine learning, and model interpretation code for our upcoming paper about the prediction of relapses of self-diagnosed porn addicts that used a mobile app to track their addictions.

Please note that the used data is not public and is not part of the repository.

The first script contains the pre-processing of the data.

The second script contains the machine learning pipeline.

The third script loads the results of the ML pipeline and generates evaluation and SHAP plots.
